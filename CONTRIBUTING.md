# How to Contribute

If it is not in Github you did not contribute...

[Understand how to use git and Github (external link)](https://github.com/wrightedu/Programmers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/blob/master/Getting-Started/git.md)
This step is probably both the most critical thing that we do not teach you here in Computer Science that 
you ***must*** learn before you can contribute code to any professional project.  

* [Making your first Pull Request](CONTRIBUTING.md#making-your-first-pull-request) (assumes you have never made a PR before)
* [General work outline (pull request process)](CONTRIBUTING.md#general-work-outline)
* [Code of Conduct](CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct)
* [Attribution](CONTRIBUTING.md#attribution)

## Making your first Pull Request

Feel free to use this project as a way to ease yourself into learning `git` if it is your first time.

A *Pull Request* (sometimes just PR) is the standard way of saying you have done some amount of work
that you would like to contribute back to the group.  To do this you simply need to do the following:

1. make sure you are on the `welcome-to-boffin` branch!
2. do something cool to make your mark on this project.  It could be as simple as [TODO]
At a minimum you should be interacting with others via comments on specific issues on the [issues page](https://github.com/BoffinFactory/PianoStaircase/issues).

This will allow you to help us move the project forward by contributing meaningful reasearch, testing, or code / examples.
Got an idea on the next steps for the project? Make a new issue!

If you already know `git` and Github, pick an issue that interests you and make a new branch!  
So long as you are working in your own branch you can't clobber someone else's work.

Pro tip: if you are going to make a branch, make sure there is a corresponding issue that you are working on
(and go ahead and add yourself to the issue).  That way everyone knows who is working on what.  Super Pro tip:
reach out to others on the same issue (or recruit others from Discord `#boffin-factory`) so you are all on the 
same page.
