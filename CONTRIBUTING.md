# How to Contribute

If it is not in Github you did not contribute...

[Understand how to use git and Github (external link)](https://github.com/wrightedu/Programmers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/blob/master/Getting-Started/git.md)
This step is probably both the most critical thing that we do not teach you here in Computer Science that 
you ***must*** learn before you can contribute code to any professional project.

## Making your first Pull Request

Feel free to use this project as a way to ease yourself into learning `git` if it is your first time.

A *Pull Request* (sometimes just PR) is the standard way of saying you have done some amount of work
that you would like to contribute back to the group.  To do this you simply need to do the following:

1. Make sure you are on the `welcome-to-boffin` branch!
2. Do something cool to make your mark on this project.  It could be as simple as walking through the 
   [Arduino Comic](TODO) and snapping a pic for the `media` folder.
3. `git add` your pic or contribution (the file you changed)
4. `git commit` and type a commit message
5. `git push`

If you are not familiar with the above commands thats fine!  Grab a fellow Boffineer and ask for help!
If you already know `git` and Github, pick an issue that interests you and make a new branch!  
So long as you are working in your own branch you can't clobber someone else's work.

At a minimum you should be interacting with others via comments on specific issues on the [issues page](https://github.com/BoffinFactory/PianoStaircase/issues).  This will allow you to help us move the project forward by contributing meaningful reasearch, testing, or code / examples.  Got an idea on the next steps for the project? Make a new issue!

## General Work Outline

1. Find an [issue](https://github.com/BoffinFactory/PianoStaircase/issues) (or make a new one) that you want to work on
2. Create a new branch and reference your issue number
3. Make something!
4. Ensure any miscelllaneous / temporary / useless files are removed before `commit` / `push` / Pull Request creation
5. Update the appropriate `README.md` with any new features or noteworthy info
6. Build something?  Take a pic! (and put it in `/media`)
7. You may merge the Pull Request once you have approval from one other developer

Pro tip: when you make a branch, make sure there is a corresponding issue that you are working on
(and go ahead and add yourself to the issue).  That way everyone knows who is working on what.  Super Pro tip:
reach out to others on the same issue (or recruit others from Discord `#boffin-factory`) so you are all on the 
same page.

## Code of Conduct

As a part of Wright State University, all contributors are expected to follow the [WSU Code of Student Conduct](https://policy.wright.edu/policy/3720-code-student-conduct).

Additionally, we hold our Boffineers (those that attend Boffin events and contribute to Boffin projects) to a higher standard than the average student in a classroom.  We expect all Boffin participants to help contribute back to a positive learning environment.  To that end, we expect students to exhibit the following behaviors:

* Using welcoming and supoortive language
* Being respecful of of others and the space / equipment
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the Boffin community
* Showing empathay towards others Boffineers
* Helping other Boffineers

Exmaples of unacceptable behaviors include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

#### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

#### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within Boffin spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the Boffin group or its community. Examples of representing a Boffin project or community include using an official Boffin chat channel, discussing Boffin community or project issues and challenges, or acting as an official Boffineer at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

#### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at `matthew.kijowski@wright.edu`, `kayleigh.duncan@wright.edu`, or `cogan.shimizu@wright.edu`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Boffineers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
