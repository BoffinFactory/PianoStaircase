# How to Contribute

If its not in Github you did not contribute...

Step 1, make sure you [understand how to use git and Gtihub](https://github.com/wrightedu/Programmers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/blob/master/Getting-Started/git.md)
This step is probably both the most critical thing that we do not teach you here in Computer Science that 
you ***must*** learn before you can contribute code to any professional project.  

That being said, feel free to use this project as a way to ease yourself into learning `git` if it is your first time.
At a minimum you should be interacting with others via comments on specific issues on the [issues page](https://github.com/BoffinFactory/PianoStaircase/issues).

This will allow you to help us move the project forward by contributing meaningful reasearch, testing, or code / examples.
Got an idea on the next steps for the project? Make a new issue!

If you already know `git` and Github, pick an issue that interests you and make a new branch!  
So long as you are working in your own branch you can't clobber someone else's work.

Pro tip: if you are going to make a branch, make sure there is a corresponding issue that you are working on
(and go ahead and add yourself to the issue).  That way everyone knows who is working on what.  Super Pro tip:
reach out to others on the same issue (or recruit others from Discord `#boffin-factory`) so you are all on the 
same page.
