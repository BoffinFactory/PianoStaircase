# First Meeting Overview

In our first meeting we will outline projects details, break the project into sprints, and learn enough GitHub to do project tracking among participants.

### Fall 2023 Sprints (DRAFT):  
1. Intro to Arduino + working with lights (basic of a simple circuit)
2. Experiment with sensors - read sensor input and use it for a meaningful action
3. Build 2+ sensor + light combos
4. Try out first phase build on stairs - use this phase to improve designs

### Spring 2024 Sprints (DRAFT): 
1. Design our own circuits
2. Manufacture our own circuits (milling boards, soldering components, etc.)
3. Test test test
4. Implement final design on Russ stairwell and invite everyone to play

Ideas of implementations & features were collected in [idea-catch.md](../idea-catch.md)
