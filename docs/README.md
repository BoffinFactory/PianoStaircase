## Project Meeting

**Thursday, October 21st at 5:00 PM in Russ 355**

## The Goal

Turn the lower steps of the Russ atrium staircase into an interactive staircase by  
integrating sensors on steps with lights and sounds.

This is a student led, mentor guided project.

## The Plan

This project will span Fall 2023 and Spring 2024.  

In our first meeting we will outline projects details, break the project into sprints, and learn enough GitHub to do project tracking among participants.

### Fall 2023 Sprints (DRAFT):  
1. Intro to Arduino + working with lights (basic of a simple circuit)
2. Experiment with sensors - read sensor input and use it for a meaningful action
3. Build 2+ sensor + light combos
4. Try out first phase build on stairs - use this phase to improve designs

### Spring 2024 Sprints (DRAFT): 
1. Design our own circuits
2. Manufacture our own circuits (milling boards, soldering components, etc)
3. Test test test
4. Implement final design on Russ stairwell and invite everyone to play

## What Students Get:

- mentorship & experience using tools throughout the sprints above
- a unique token of participation in this Boffin Build Project
- connection with career services to write their experience into resumes

## Sponsors

Support was provided by the Students First Fund of the Wright State University Foundation
