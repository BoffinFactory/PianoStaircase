# [Piano Staircase](https://boffinfactory.github.io/PianoStaircase/)

A Boffin build project.

[boffinfactory.github.io/PianoStaircase](https://boffinfactory.github.io/PianoStaircase/)

## Outline

Using sensors with arduino and the [Arduino MIDI-USB](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/midiusb/) library
we will detect a footstep on a stair and send that note to a raspberry pi
software synth program [fluidsynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/) for output to speakers.

End result, a piano staircase (whee)!

## Getting Involved

In order to get involved you just need to check two things:

1. Check out our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file to figure out how to 
  interact with the project and what our current focus points are.
2. Check out the [Issues page](https://github.com/BoffinFactory/PianoStaircase/issues)

Thats really it.  We have a ton of example source code and installation / config scripts in `./src/`
and there should be a few example setups floating around on the Boffin desk (table with record player).
