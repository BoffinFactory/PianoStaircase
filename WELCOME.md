# Welcome to Boffin!

New or just getting started, feel free to play around!

Your mission (should you choose to accept it), is to do something cool, fun (or dumb) and take a picture or video of it.  Then, working with someone who knows `git`, upload it to this branch `welcome-to-boffin`.

Feel free to use the browser!  Once you have something to contribute, make a PR (pull request).

I have created a `./media/` folder for various pics and videos.

## Challenge mode

After you have done the above, try making an issue or tackling one of our existing issues!
